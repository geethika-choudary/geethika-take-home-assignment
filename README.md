Source Code for the Take Home Assignment

This repository consists of the source code required to finish all the challenges in the take home assignment. 

I have taken the corresponding screenshots for all the tasks that require it and attached it in the file "Demo.pdf" in this directory since ReadMe doesn't support images.

NOTE: I have added another question in the app “How are you?” with choices “I am fine” and “Not so great” for testing purposes, kindly ignore if it’s not of use.
